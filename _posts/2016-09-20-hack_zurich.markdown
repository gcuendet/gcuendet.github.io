Last week-end, 565 enthusiastic software/mobile/web developers or hackers
participated in the third edition of [HackZurich][hackzurich] in Zurich's
TechnoPark. I was one of them. The opening ceremony started with this cool
video, check it out if you don't know what HackZurich is (and even if you do):

After attending inspiring workshops, the first one by Raiffeisen, TI&M and Aduno
to motivate hackers to define the future of payment, using cool tech gadgets
(raspberry pi based vending machine, autonomous car model, miniature drones,
etc...) and the second one by AMAG and Porsche Holding and cool tech talks by
SBB and Google, hacking started!

I teamed up with a colleague and friend to implement a completely automatic fuel
logbook. Starting from two datasets we got during the workshops, the idea was to
fuse data coming from the car and personal financial transactions data in order
to automatically log the number of liters and cost of each fill-up. These data
would then be used to update the budget dedicated to fuel with real numbers and
generate some stats and visualizations.
Check out the slides we presented to the jury:
