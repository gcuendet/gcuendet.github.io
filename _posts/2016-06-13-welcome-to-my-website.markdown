It seems my quest for a convenient way of centralizing the information available
about me is near an end.
I just discovered Jekyll while searching for tools to build my personal website
and it seems that it is exactly what I needed.
So, here it is! Welcome to my website!

I am not going to write extensively about Jekyll, but I'd like to acknowledge a
few resources which have proven to be useful:

- Of course, the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs]{: target="_blank"} have been
  extremely useful. They are a good introduction and give quickly a pretty
  decent idea of how everything is organized.
- And the following websites were a few examples from which I got inspired:

  + [Steven V. Miller][svmiller]{: target="_blank"}
  + [Nathalie Villa-Vialaneix][nv2]{: target="_blank"}
  + [Ali Hadian][hadian]{: target="_blank"}

[jekyll-docs]: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home
[hadian]: http://hadian.org
[svmiller]: http://svmiller.com
[nv2]: http://www.nathalievilla.org
