Welcome! I am a PhD student and research assistant in the [Signal Processing Lab (LTS5)][lts5] at [Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)][epfl].

My main research interests include Computer Vision and Machine Learning and more specifically Facial Images Analysis.
I am focusing on applications of automatic Face modelling for medical diagnosis.

### Trying to predict difficult intubation...

Among those applications I work on the prediction of difficult endotracheal intubation, a pre-operative assessment problem in anaesthesiology.
The assessment is based on images and videos of the face of real patients. Fitting a face model on these images allows us to automatically extract specific morphological features of the patient.
Using machine learning techniques, those features are used to provide the final assessment.
