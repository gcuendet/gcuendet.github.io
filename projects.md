#### My current research topic: Prediction of difficult intubation...

In my current research topic, I am focusing on applications of 2D and 3D automatic face modelling for medical diagnosis.
Among those applications I work on the prediction of difficult endotracheal intubation, a pre-operative assessment problem in anaesthesiology.
The assessment is based on images and videos of the face of patients. Fitting a face model on these images allows us to automatically extract specific morphological features of the patient.
Using machine learning techniques, those features are used to provide the final assessment.

Some of the challenges we are facing are the relatively poor understanding of all the factors linked with the endotracheal intubation's difficulty as well as its inherent subjectivity.
The large imbalance in the occurence of a difficult intubation also makes the data collection more difficult.
We used feature selection methods to gain insight about which are the most informative features and develop imbalance learning methods to tackle the lack of difficult intubation examples.

#### ... using automatic 2D/3D face models

The face models mentionned in the prediction of difficult endotracheal intubation task can be a 2D or a 3D generative of discriminative statistical model.
These models thus describe a population of faces which they are learned from.
Acquiring the data, cleaning and pre-processing it and designing, implementing and learning the models are parts of my work.

Some of the main challenges are that the models need to generalize to a large population eventhough they are trained on limited data.
Fitting a model to a previously unseen face also needs to be fast, as it is often only the first step of the algorithm and other features need to be extracted on top of that.
