<h1 class="post-title">About me</h1>

![][photo]{:height="300px",width="225px"}

I am a senior software engineer in the Deep Learning team at [Cognex]().

I obtained a PhD in Electrical engineering in the [Signal Processing Lab (LTS5)][LTS5]{:target="_blank"} at [Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)][EPFL]{:target="_blank"} in 2017.
In my thesis, I was focusing on applications of 2D and 3D automatic facial image analysis and face modeling for medical diagnosis.

After obtaining the PhD, I did a postdoc at IBM Research in Zurich and then worked as an R&D engineer in Computer Vision at [Pix4D](http://www.pix4d.com), where I developed core algorithms for a professional drone photogrammetry software suite.

In general, my main interests include Computer Vision and Machine Learning and more specifically 3D geometry processing.
Specifically, I have particularly enjoyed working on non rigid surface alignement by optimizing low frequencies Fourier coefficients or filtering of 3D point clouds in the spectral domain using spectral methods on graphs.

I am passionate about developing and implementing new methods and algorithms for computer vision and machine learning problems.
In my free time I play the violin and enjoy chamber music sessions with friends.
When I am not playing, I might be hacking a raspberry pi, skiing or sailing, depending on the season ;-)
