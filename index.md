<h1 class="post-title">About me</h1>

![][photo]{:height="300px",width="225px"}

I am a C++ software developer in Computer Vision at [Pix4D][http://www.pix4d.com].
I obtained a PhD in Electrical engineering in the [Signal Processing Lab (LTS5)][LTS5]{:target="_blank"} at [Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)][EPFL]{:target="_blank"}.

My main research interests include Computer Vision and Machine Learning and more specifically Facial Image Analysis.
In my thesis, I was focusing on applications of 2D and 3D automatic face modeling for medical diagnosis.
Now, at Pix4D, I work on photogrammetry.

I am passionate about developing and implementing new methods and algorithms for computer vision and image analysis problems.
In my free time I play the violin and enjoy chamber music sessions with friends.
When I am not playing, I might be hacking a raspberry pi, skiing or sailing, depending on the season ;-)
